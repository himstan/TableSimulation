# TableSimulation

### How to use

#### After you start the main program you will be presented by some instructions.

Here you can set the table's width and height, and also your starting positions on this table. 
We can follow the example input the program gives us.

Now we created a 4x4 table and set our starting position at (2,2)  
(*The table indexes start from 0, so the upper-left corner of the table will be on (0,0) and the lower-right corner will be (3,3)*)

Here we can give the commands the program will execute during the simulation.  
We can see that our commands are numbers from 0 to 4 and we can see what action each will do.  
Lets type in the example input the program gives us.

We got the output of [0,1] which means that when our simulation ended, we were staying on the cordinates of (0,1).  
It's important to note that the command list should always end with zero, otherwise our program wont run the simulation.
